				<p>Hey there! I'm Sophie. A 13 Y/O transgender full stack game developer on the Roblox Platform. </p>
				<p>I love to code and have been doing so since I was 8! I've worked for quite a few people, being on and
					off projects.</p>
				<p>I've created Inventory Systems; with automatically update UI (The Usual IG), Libraries and a lot
					more! One of my current projects is a math library to improve the current experience with
					mathematics in roblox! I've noticed it could do with improvements, so that what I am working on!
				</p>
				<p>I also stream <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/isophes">on twitch! </a> I usually broadcast my
					experiences problem-solving bugs and having a good time creating whatever I endeavour on! </p>

			<article id="11thFloor">
				<h2 class="major">11th Floor</h2>

				<p>

					11th Floor was a project that I created with three other people for the <a
						href="https://discord.gg/Sxh9ZfeCzj">VectorThree Game Jam.</a>
					<br />
					<br />
					As of 4th February 2023 (Time of writing), the results have not been announced. I'll try and update
					it here once they are. But there is information that they are filming games!
					<br />
					<br />
					11th Floor was created with the theme "Looks can be deceiving"; we originally was going for a
					non-euclidean game. I had made a couple features for the game, but the project's lead was in burnout
					and hadn't got anything done for it. So we ended up just putting everything we had made together and
					hoped for the best.

				<ul>
					<h3>What went well:</h3>
					<br />
					<li>I had learnt how to use Rojo and Github, something that I really appreciate learning; I use it
						in everything and greatly prefer it over the default Roblox Studio editor.</li>
					<br />
					<li>I had learnt great teamwork skills. As the Jam was in groups, I had to use communication skills
						and teamwork to try and get the game done. I'm happy I did this since it would definitely keep
						me back if I was working on a studio. </li>
					<br />
					<li>I learnt CollectionService. I wanted a way that the player could collect "Objects" around the
						map to complete tasks. So the thing that came to mind was collectionservice. It allows things to
						have "tags" and then I can just check if the object has said tag, and then instantly know what
						to do from one central script instead of having scripts inside of objects; which was a big
						no-no.</li>
					<br />
					<li>I had created a game; something I had wanted to do for a while. It wasn't a good one, but it was
						a game. It just satisfies me that I could make something that worked like this, with no outside
						help except from documentation</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<h3>What didn't go well:</h3>
					<br />
					<li>We hadn't met what we wanted. Time was really important, and none of us had all of the time that
						we really needed. The guy that was supposed to make the main feature, had left us.</li>
					<li>We had totally missed the theme; we should've made multiple features revolve around the theme.
						To comply with the theme, we had planned a non-euclidean game. But with the lead dev doing
						nothing like said above, we were left with no option but to miss the ttheme completely.</li>
				</ul>

			<article id="QuelliterAbilities">
				<h2 class="major">Quelliter Abilities System</h2>

				<p>
					This system was designed for <a href="https://discord.gg/KYHpEv3gnE"> Roadway Studios' Quelliter
					</a>
					<br />
					The main premise of the system is that you collect an orb and you get an ability. Once the timer on
					it runs out, you can't use it anymore
				</p>

				<ul>
					What went well:

					<br />
					<br />

					<li> I had learnt a lot about positioning things. I had ran into an issue where I had to get the
						orbs to be aligned with "tiles"; the game is inspired by the popular <a
							href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Spleef">"Spleef"</a> gamemode on Minecraft. It
						taught me about how to use Vector3 and CFrame to position things on a scale consistantly. </li>
					<li> I had learnt how to properly tween elements well and make good-looking animations.</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					What didn't go well:

					<br />
					<br />

					<li> The code was messy. Really messy. Everything was everywhere and not in one spot where I could
						easily access it. Everything is about learning, and this was something. </li>
					<li> UI was controlled on the server. Yes, I did the one forbidden practise that nobody should do. I
						accessed the player's PlayerGui on the server an edited it from there. I believe this was one of
						the stupidest things to ever do. </li>
					<li> It wouldn't work on an in-game scenario. Later on, we had ran the system in the actual
						matchmaking system and it only half-worked. As the code was messy, it was a pain to fix. We have
						moved the task to a new team member whilst I take time off to learn practises and work on my own
						things. </li>
				</ul>

			<article id="MathPlus">
				<h2 class="major">MathPlus</h2>

				<p> MathPlus is an Open-Source Library designed to streamline Math in Roblox
					<br />
					<br />
					The current state of the project is that it's very not finished. Progress has also been halted for
					another project that I'm working on, but I'm working on it gradually. It currently is trying to just
					have extended support (Tables + Multiple Number Support) for default math functions with the goal to
					integrate many other math functions from other languages to this one.

					Island Tycoon is my latest project, where I am working with <a

					The Project is a tycoon game designed to be more casual. This game is a follow up of Meknor's
